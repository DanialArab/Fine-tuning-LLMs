# Fine tuning LLMs

This repo documents my understanding of fine-tuning LLMs, which is mostly based on chapters 1, 2, and 6 of the book **<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch">Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)</a>** by Sebastian Raschka. 

Here, I will focus on **classification fine-tunning** as a technique to get LLM working as an alternative to traditional classifiers.
